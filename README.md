# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Tools and Technology Used

This application currently uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. It is also mobile friendly/responsive.

## Plans for Improvement

Future improvements include adding more weather types and clothing recommendations.
Eventually users will be able to add their own clothing selections for different weather variations.
It'd also be great to update weather location automatically by IP address location.
