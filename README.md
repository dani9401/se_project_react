# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

WhatToWear is a simple application that users visit to get suggestions on weather-appropriate clothing to wear that day. Weather forecast is determined by data collected from a third-party API. 
Frontend Code primarily uses Javascript, React, JSX, CSS, BEM. Backend Code primarily uses Express, MongoDB, Google Cloud
This application aims to solve an age-old morning question; What Should I Wear Today?
Users can sign up, login, create a profile, add their own clothing items, click to "like" or "unlike" certain clothing items, and more.

## Tools and Technology Used

This application currently uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. It is also mobile friendly/responsive.

## Plans for Improvement

Future improvements include adding more weather types and smarter clothing recommendations.
It'd also be great to update weather location automatically by IP address location.
Add a "friends" feature to the application so people can connect with their friends and see their clothing items.

Coming soon.
